## Usage
### Database architecture

RA database structure is composed of several tables (data models) such as IDO (Interstitial Dissolved Oxygen), which is linked to a MeasPosition (measurement positions) via a foreign key. The figure below illustrates the database architecture through an Entity-Relationship diagram:

![River Analyst database architecture][d-struc]

Figure 2 and 3 provide detailed descriptions of the several attributes within each of RA data models described above.

### Running the app
- Go to repository directory

    ``cd path/to/river-analyst``
- Make migrations (optional)

    ``python3 manage.py migrate``
Obs.: Migrations are in principle python commands wrapped around SQL passed from the Django framework to the sql database.
- Run the server locally

    ``python3 manage.py runserver``
- Create superuser for having full admin rights over the app:

    ``python3 manage.py createsuperuser``
  
## Initializing a new database with template CSVs
- Add data to the csv templates under the path ``riveranalyst/river-analyst/media/``
- ``cd`` to the ``riveranalyst/utils`` directory
    ``cd riveranalyst/utils``
- Execute scripts to initialize targeted data models
    - It is important to begin with populating the **MeasPosition** model, which is where all data models connect:
        - Here, it is crucial that the field ``meas_position`` is unique and contains no typos. This field will be used to generate foreign keys to link data models.
    ``python fill_measpositions_tab.py``
    - Then, any data model can be populated afterwards, for instance:
        - the field ``meas_position`` needs to match the names given in the MeasPosition data model.
            - ``python fill_surf_tab.py`` for filling the **SurfaceSed** data model
            - ``python fill_subsurf_tab.py`` for the **SubSurfaceSed** data model
            - ``python fill_kf_tab.py`` for the **Kf** (Riverbed Hydraulic Conductivity) data model
            - ``python fill_do_tab.py`` for the **IDO** (Interstitial Dissolved Oxygen) data model
            - ``python fill_hydraulics_tab.py`` for the **Hydraulics** data model

## Django cheat sheet (interacting with the Database via Python)
You can create a new Django object by:

```python
obj = ModelName(field_name=value)
obj.save()
```

Querying the database is very simple:
```python
ModelName.objects.all() # get all objects

# get objects with field_name = value
ModelName.objects.filter(field_name=value) 

# get a single object with field_name = value
ModelName.objects.get(field_name=value) 
```

To create a new Django model, you need to define a class in one of your Django app's ``models.py`` file that inherits from Django's built-in models.Model class.
Here is an example model class that defines a Book model with fields for title, author, and publication date:
```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateField()
```

# Connecting the project with a database file stored in the cloud (Example for AWS RDS)
- Install the psycopg2 library: Since AWS RDS supports PostgreSQL, you will need to install the psycopg2 library, which is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python, by running the following command:
```console
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

- Configure the Django project settings: In your Django project's settings.py file, you will need to configure the database settings to connect to your AWS RDS instance. Here is an example configuration for a PostgreSQL database:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your-db-name',
        'USER': 'your-db-username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your-db-password',
        'HOST': 'your-db-endpoint.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

In the above configuration, you will need to replace ``your-db-name``, ``your-db-username``, and ``your-db-password`` with your own values, and replace ``your-db-endpoint`` and ``aws-region`` with the endpoint and region of your AWS RDS instance, respectively. You can find your RDS instance's endpoint in the RDS console.

- Migrate the Django project: Once you have configured your database settings, you will need to run the following commands to migrate the Django project to the database:
```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
These commands will create the necessary tables and columns in your database.

- Test the connection: Finally, you can test the connection to your AWS RDS instance by running the following command:
```console
python manage.py dbshell
```
This command will open a PostgreSQL shell that connects to your database. If the connection is successful, you should see a prompt that looks like this:

```php
psql (13.4, server 13.3)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

your-db-name=>
```
